A User Event script for enforcing a single instance of any record type(s) to which it is deployed.

*Don't deploy this to any native record types.*

I typically use this for Configuration-type custom records which I employ for Integration projects, but
you can apply it to any Custom Record Type where it only makes sense for a single instance to exist.
